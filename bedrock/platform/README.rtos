Here's a release of the "Bedrock Real-Time Operating System" for the HACMS
ground team.  See `rtos_app.c' for an example application, `Makefile' for build
procedure, and `bedrock.h' for API documentation.

Note that there are separate releases for 32-bit and 64-bit x86, differing
only in the .s assembly files.
